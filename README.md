## 🔍 Inverted Search in C

### 🧩 Project Overview

The **Inverted Search Project** is a C-based application that creates an **index of words** from multiple text files, allowing users to **search for a word efficiently** across all files. It demonstrates **file handling**, **data structures**, and **efficient search algorithms**, making it a practical implementation of **information retrieval systems**.

### 🚀 Features

* 📂 **Read and index** words from multiple text files
* 🔎 **Search** for a word and view all files where it appears
* 🗂️ Uses **hash tables and linked lists** for fast lookups
* 💾 Supports **dynamic file handling** and efficient memory use
* 🧠 Demonstrates **data structure implementation in C**

---

### ⚙️ Technologies Used

* **Language:** C
* **Concepts:** File I/O, Hashing, Linked Lists, String handling
* **Platform:** Linux / Windows (GCC Compiler)

---

### 🧪 Example Usage

```bash
# Build database from text files
./inverted_search file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt

# Search for a specific word
./inverted_search -s "example"
```

### 📄 Learning Outcomes

* Understanding **hash-based indexing** and **search optimization**
* Hands-on experience with **file parsing and dynamic memory allocation**
* Implementation of **custom data structures** in C

---

### 📚 Future Enhancements

* Add **delete and update** operations for indexed files
* Implement **GUI visualization** for search results
* Add **stop-word filtering** and **case-insensitive search**
